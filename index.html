    <p>Crochet is a process of creating textiles by 
        using a <strong> crochet hook </strong> to interlock loops of yarn, 
        thread, or strands of other materials. The name is
         derived from the French term crochet, meaning 'hook'.
         Hooks can be made from a variety of materials, 
         such as metal, wood, bamboo, bone or plastic. You can read more at
